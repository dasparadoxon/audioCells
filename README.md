Audio Cells is a visualizer for audio elements. It takes fft-information and feeds it into a cell grid that fires it through its pattern.

Four cell layers are influcing each other, from all four sides.

More documentation and videos soon. 

You can of course run this sample anytime, you will need the audio engine deliverd by Processing via the libraries, though.
